* the goal is like a king on a chess board. he moves very slowly and deliberately.
   * [ ] publish about the associative scan in actuarial journal
   * [ ] do the julia term model

notes

* vectorized modeling approaches consume much more memory than traditional modeling approaches, but allow for greater parallelization.
* many floating point operations may occur in generalized linear models that have many parameters
* bfloat16 vs. float32 vs float64 matters for speed, are differences caused by float32 vs float64 material?
* lapse rates is really all that is left to do
