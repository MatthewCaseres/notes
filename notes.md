* It is not so bad to refactor a class method to be a pure function. 
delete all references to `self.` and the relevant variables should highlight themselves in red.
  * The reason you might use something like Equinox is because maybe the class attributes are separate for the purpose of doing a gradient descent over. It is about having a certain representation of the `Pytree` that is easy to work with.
* I wanted to be some pioneer inventing new things, but really there is so much for me to learn. Pay attention if someone needs something in the open source community, it is more valuable to help someone with a need than to try to convince people that you are doing something important.
* academics own the pedagogy. don't bother trying to teach things at too low a level. information is presented for practitioners.
